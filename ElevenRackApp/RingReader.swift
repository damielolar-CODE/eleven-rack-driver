// RingReader.swift — read-only observer of the shared-memory audio ring.
//
// Attaches to the ring the engine publishes and reports, per poll, whether the
// engine is pulling audio from USB, whether an app is actively consuming the
// device, and how many overruns happened since the last poll. It NEVER calls
// er_in_read/er_out_read (those move the consumer index owned by coreaudiod) —
// only field reads and the non-destructive peek helpers are used.
